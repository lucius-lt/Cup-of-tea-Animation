Cup of Tea (HTML & CSS Animation)

This project is a fun front-end experiment that recreates a realistic cup of tea with steam animation using only HTML and CSS. It focuses on CSS properties like position, flexbox, border-radius, box-shadow, gradients, and @keyframes to build an aesthetic illustration without relying on images or JavaScript.

âœ¨ Features

  Plate and Cup Design:

    The plate is styled with border-radius and box-shadow for a subtle 3D effect.

    The cup is constructed using simple divs with rounded corners and shadows to mimic depth.

    The handle is created using pseudo-elements (::before).

 Top View with Coffee:

    A circular layer represents the top of the cup.

    The inner circle (.coffee) gives the appearance of tea/coffee, styled with a warm brown (sienna) and inner shadows.

  Steam/Vapour Animation:

    Multiple <span> elements rise above the cup to simulate steam.

    Each span uses a custom property (--i) for staggered animation delays.

    The animation (@keyframes rise) makes vapour float upwards, expand, blur, and fade away.

    This creates a smooth, natural-looking steaming effect.
